<h1>Recursive Number Manipulator</h1>
    
   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>
        The Recursive Number Manipulator is a Java program that performs a recursive operation on a given number based on a specific rule. The program takes an input 'n' and applies the following rule recursively: subtract 5 from the number until it reaches 0 or becomes negative, then add 5 to the number until it reaches the original input 'n'. The program prints the resulting values at each step.
    </p>

  <h2>Example Usage</h2>
  <p>
        Suppose we have the following example:
        <br>
        Input: n = 16
        <br>
        Output: 16 11 6 1 -4 1 6 11 16
    </p>
